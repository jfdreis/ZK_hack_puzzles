#Solution

Here we are going to write the reasoning that may lead us to a solution of the problem.
We suggest the reader to consult [1](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381#BLS-digital-signatures).

## Information that we have

>- We are working with the BLS12-381 curve.
This means that we have two curves:
$E_1$ defined by $y^2=x^3+4$ over $\mathbb(F)_q$ and
$E_2$ defined by $y^2=x^3+4(1+u)$ over $\mathbb(F)_{q^2}$ where $q$ is known, see [1](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381#BLS-digital-signatures).

> - There are groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ that are generate, respectively, by $g_1$ and $g_2$.

> - We are given values of $g_1$, $s \cdot g_1$ in $G_1$ and $g_2$, $s \cdot g_2$ in $G_2$ we want to determine $s$, where $s \in \mathbb{Z}_{q}$.

## Idea

> - Let $r$ be the order of the $G_1$, which is generated by $g_1$.
> - Factor the order of the group $G_1$. That is $r=p_1p_2 \ldots p_m$ for some primes $p_i$.
> - The element $(p_2p_3\ldots p_m) \cdot g_1$ has order $p_1$.

So we can think of the group this element generates as $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1}$.
Moreover, $(p_2p_3\ldots p_m)s\cdot g_1=s(p_2p_3\ldots p_m)\cdot g_1$ is in $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1}$. So, there is an $\alpha_1 \in \mathbb{Z}_{p_1}$ such that $s=\alpha_1$ mod $p_1$.

> - Find $\alpha_1$
> - Repeat the process for "small" primes $p_i$. Thanks to the chinese remainder theorem, we will obtain $s=s_1$ mod $n_1$, where $n_1$ is the product of the "small" primes.

> - Do the same with $G_2$.
> - Possibly we obtain $s=s_2$ mod $n_2$, and then we find $s$ mod $n_1 \times n_2$.


Hopefully this will work out.
